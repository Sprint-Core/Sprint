What is Sprint?
----------------

Sprint is an experimental digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Sprint uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Sprint Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Sprint Core software, see http://www.sprintpay.net.


License
-------

Sprint Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is normally done in separate branches.
[Tags](https://github.com/Sprint-Core/Sprint/tags) are created to indicate new official,
stable release versions of Sprint Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.


Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
