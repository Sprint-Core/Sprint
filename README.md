What is Sprint?
----------------

Sprint is an experimental digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Sprint uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Sprint Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Sprint Core software, see http://www.sprintpay.net.
